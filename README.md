# learn hapi â€” Starter Files
This repository contains the **Futureflix Starter Kit** for the [learn hapi](http://learnhapi.com) learning path.

Youâ€™ll implement Futureflix as a sample app while following the tutorials in this [hapi](https://hapijs.com) learning path.

At this point, the current projectâ€™s implementation is only available for enrolled students. If youâ€™re part of the Future Studio University, youâ€™ve access to the code, hosted on GitLab.


## Requirements
To run the **Futureflix Starter Kit**, please install the following dependencies:

- Node.js v6.x or later
- NPM or Yarn to install the projectâ€™s dependencies
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) or a [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) instance on your machine

Seems doable, huh? ðŸ˜ƒ


## Setup and Run
To run your own Futureflix instance, clone this repository, install the dependencies, start a MongoDB instance in a Vagrant VM or on your own machine.

```bash
# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/fs-opensource/futureflix-starter-kit.git
cd futureflix-starter-kit

# install dependencies
npm i

# start Vagrant box
vagrant up

# create your secrets.env file from secrets.env.example
cp secrets.env.sample secrets.env

# import sample data
npm run pumpitup

# start the server
node server.js

# thatâ€™s it :)
```

The starter kit doesnâ€™t contain any logging. If you donâ€™t see any errors while starting the `server.js`,
[visit localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Have fun!


## Getting Help
At this point, thereâ€™s no Slack channel or support group. If you need help with your implementation, please use email. Weâ€™re active on emails and reply as soon as possible.

This repository accompanies you with the **Futureflix Starter Kit** and is not meant to be a support channel.
